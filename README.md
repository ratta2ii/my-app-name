## Description

I am trying to host this on Azure and coming up with the following error. This repo contains ONLY the necessary files (I think) to solve this problem.

Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/home/site/wwwroot/server/dist/index.html'

#### Repo: 

https://github.com/ratta2ii/my-app-name.git

#### My thoughts are one of these being the problem: 

1. the structure of my files

2.  the scripts in the package.json(s) (one in root directory and one in client)

3. in server/server.js (line 24-26)
